# WDD131 Class Project: Enhanced Dynamic Website using HTML, JavaScript, PHP, and CSS

## Overview
This project is part of the WDD131 (Enhanced Web Development) class, where students build dynamic websites using a combination of HTML, JavaScript, PHP, and CSS. The website will feature both client-side and server-side interactions, showcasing dynamic content, user interactivity, and server-side processing.

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a multi-page, enhanced website that incorporates dynamic functionalities such as form handling, database connections, and real-time interactivity. Using HTML and CSS for the structure and styling, JavaScript for client-side interactivity, and PHP for server-side scripting, the project demonstrates a full-stack approach to web development.

### Features:
- **Client-Side Interactivity:** JavaScript is used to enhance the user experience with dynamic elements such as forms, modals, and validation.
- **Server-Side Processing:** PHP handles form submissions, processes data, and interacts with a MySQL database for storing and retrieving information.
- **Responsive Design:** The website adapts to various screen sizes and devices using modern CSS techniques.
- **User Authentication:** Basic login and registration system using PHP sessions and MySQL.
- **Form Handling:** Includes validation on both the client-side (JavaScript) and server-side (PHP).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For the content and structure of the website.
- **CSS3:** For the design, layout, and responsive styling.
- **JavaScript:** For client-side logic, DOM manipulation, and interactive features.
- **PHP:** For server-side scripting, form handling, and database interaction.
